Problem 2

Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

input: array []

output: array []

Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

NON - RECURSIVE NO FILTER FUNCTION

function removeDuplicate(inArr) {



let outArr = []

inArr.forEach(function(character) {
  if (outArr.includes(character)) {
    return
  } else {
    outArr.push(character)
  }
}
return outArr;


}

RECURSIVE 

Base Case:
when the we have looped through the entire array. 

function recursiceDuplicate(inArr, counter=0, outArr =[]) {
  if (counter === inArr.length - 1) {
    return outArr;
  } else {
    if ()
    return recursiveDuplicate(inArr, counter + 1, outArr.push())
  }
}

*SOLVING THE PROBLEM WITHOUT RECURSION USING FILTER()*

function filterDuplicate(inArr) {
  const results = inArr.filter(take each character as an argument, if that character is in the array, filter out )
  return results array;

}
